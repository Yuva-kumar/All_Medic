	<p style={{fontSize:"11px"}}>Fever is often a response to an underlying infection or illness. When the body detects the presence of pathogens such as bacteria or viruses, it may release chemicals called pyrogens. These pyrogens act on the hypothalamus, the part of the brain that regulates body temperature, causing it to increase.</p>
	<h3>what are the causes </h3>
	<p>Fever can be caused by various factors, and it is often a symptom of an underlying condition. Here are some common causes of fever:

	1. **Infections:** The most common cause of fever is an infection, whether bacterial, viral, fungal, or parasitic. Examples include the flu, common cold, urinary tract infections, pneumonia, and many others.

	2. **Inflammatory Conditions:** Some non-infectious inflammatory conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis or inflammatory bowel disease, can also lead to fever.

	3. **Heat-related Illness:** Exposure to extreme heat, leading to conditions like heat exhaustion or heatstroke, can result in fever.

	4. **Certain Medications:** Some medications may cause fever as a side effect. It's important to check with a healthcare professional if you suspect that a medication is causing your fever.

	5. **Vaccination:** Fever can be a common side effect of certain vaccines as the body mounts an immune response.

	6. **Autoimmune Disorders:** Conditions where the immune system mistakenly attacks the body's own tissues, such as lupus or certain types of arthritis, can cause fever.
