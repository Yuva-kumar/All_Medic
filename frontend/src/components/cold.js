           <h1>what is cold</h1>
	<p>Common Cold (Illness): In the context of illness, "cold" often refers to the common cold. The common cold is a viral infection of the upper respiratory tract, usually caused by rhinoviruses. Symptoms include a runny or stuffy nose, sneezing, coughing, and sometimes a sore throat or mild fever.</p>
	<h2> what are the cause for cold</h2>
	<p>Person-to-Person: The cold viruses are highly contagious and can be spread from person to person through respiratory droplets. This can occur when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks, releasing tiny droplets into the air that can be inhaled by others.

	Touching Contaminated Surfaces: Touching surfaces or objects that have the cold virus on them and then touching the face, especially the nose, mouth, or eyes, can lead to infection.

	Close Contact: Being in close contact with an infected person, such as hugging or shaking hands, can facilitate the spread of the virus.

	Viral Shedding: Infected individuals can shed the virus even before they show symptoms, making it possible to transmit the virus unknowingly.</p>
