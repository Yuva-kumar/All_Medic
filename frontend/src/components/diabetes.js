            <p>Diabetes is a chronic medical condition that occurs when the body is unable to properly regulate blood sugar (glucose) levels. Glucose is a crucial source of energy for cells, and its levels need to be tightly controlled for the body to function properly. The hormone insulin, produced by the pancreas, plays a key role in this regulation.</p>
